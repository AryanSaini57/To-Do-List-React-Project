# To-Do List App

This is my first project using React, a simple To-Do List application. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It's designed with a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Add Items**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Delete Items**: Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Each task has a checkbox to mark it as completed.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.
